diag/toeplitz preconditioners
- open problems
- last, failure
- examples
- dense determinant calculations
- diagonal scaling small fields - other explore minpoly
- Monte Carlo: needs verification
- small vs large 
- give examples, try algorithms
- 
### Analysis: 
- Time complexity
- extra
- n / n^3
