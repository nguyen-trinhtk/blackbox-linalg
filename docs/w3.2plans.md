Certainly. Here's a clean version of the experiments, without emojis or symbols:

## **SageMath Experiments to Study What Influences $k$**

These experiments aim to explore which properties of $u$, $A$, and $v$ affect how many Krylov sequence elements are needed before the Berlekampâ€“Massey algorithm finds the true minimal polynomial.

We will implement and run three experiments.

---

### **Helper Functions**

```python
def krylov_sequence(u, A, v, length):
    return [u * (A^i * v) for i in range(length)]

def berlekamp_massey(seq, F=QQ):
    R = PolynomialRing(F, 'x')
    return R(lfsr_connection_polynomial(seq))
```

### **Experiment 1: Influence of the Minimal Polynomial Degree**

This experiment compares a random full-rank matrix to a nilpotent matrix to show how the degree of the minimal polynomial affects when the recurrence is discovered.

```python
def experiment_min_poly_degree():
    F = QQ
    n = 5

    # Random full-rank matrix
    A1 = random_matrix(F, n, algorithm='unimodular')
    u1 = random_vector(F, n)
    v1 = random_vector(F, n)

    # Nilpotent matrix with minimal polynomial x^2
    A2 = zero_matrix(F, n)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        A2[i, i + 1] = 1
    u2 = random_vector(F, n)
    v2 = random_vector(F, n)

    for label, A, u, v in [('Full-min-poly', A1, u1, v1), ('Low-min-poly', A2, u2, v2)]:
        print(f"\n--- {label} ---")
        seq = krylov_sequence(u, A, v, 2 * n)
        min_poly_full = berlekamp_massey(seq)
        print(f"Min poly: {min_poly_full}")
        for k in range(n, 2 * n):
            if berlekamp_massey(seq[:k]) == min_poly_full:
                print(f"  Found at k = {k}")
                break
    
```

### **Experiment 2: Controllability (Effect of Vector $v$)**

This experiment sets $v$ aligned with a single eigenvector to show how poor controllability leads to faster recurrence.

```python
def experiment_controllability():
    F = QQ
    n = 5
    A = diagonal_matrix(F, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    
    # Poorly controllable: v is aligned with one eigenvector
    v = vector(F, [1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    u = random_vector(F, n)

    print("\n--- Poor Controllability ---")
    seq = krylov_sequence(u, A, v, 2 * n)
    min_poly_full = berlekamp_massey(seq)
    print(f"Min poly: {min_poly_full}")
    for k in range(n, 2 * n):
        if berlekamp_massey(seq[:k]) == min_poly_full:
            print(f"  Found at k = {k}")
            break
```

---

### **Experiment 3: Structured Matrices (Symmetric vs Nilpotent)**

Compare a symmetric matrix with a nilpotent matrix to illustrate how matrix structure influences the recurrence.

```python
def experiment_structure():
    F = QQ
    n = 5

    # Symmetric matrix
    M = random_matrix(F, n)
    A1 = (M + M.transpose()) / 2
    u1 = random_vector(F, n)
    v1 = random_vector(F, n)

    # Strictly upper triangular matrix (nilpotent)
    A2 = zero_matrix(F, n)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        A2[i, i + 1] = 1
    u2 = random_vector(F, n)
    v2 = random_vector(F, n)

    for label, A, u, v in [('Symmetric', A1, u1, v1), ('Nilpotent', A2, u2, v2)]:
        print(f"\n--- {label} Matrix ---")
        seq = krylov_sequence(u, A, v, 2 * n)
        min_poly_full = berlekamp_massey(seq)
        print(f"Min poly: {min_poly_full}")
        for k in range(n, 2 * n):
            if berlekamp_massey(seq[:k]) == min_poly_full:
                print(f"  Found at k = {k}")
                break
```

### **Summary of Observations**

| Factor                    | Effect on $k$                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minimal polynomial of $A$ | Sets upper bound on needed $k$                               |
| Controllability (via $v$) | Poor controllability leads to faster recurrence              |
| Observability (via $u$)   | Same as above, affects sequence rank                         |
| Matrix structure          | Symmetric or nilpotent matrices often give faster recurrence |
| Rank and eigenstructure   | Defective matrices can reduce minimal polynomial degree      |

You can now call these experiments in Sage like this:

```python
experiment_min_poly_degree()
experiment_controllability()
experiment_structure()
```

Would you like a single script version or help converting this to a Sage worksheet or Jupyter notebook format?
