# Optimized Linear System Solver & Analyzer

### Based on Wiedemann's Algorithm — STAR 2025

This is a supporting tool for my research on **Solving Large Linear Systems Efficiently with Wiedemann's Algorithm**.

---

## Core Features
- C++ solver for large systems with NTL + GMP (exact arithmetic) based on Wiedemann's Algorithm
- CSV analyzer for structure, stability & runtime metrics
- Lightweight & reproducible, easy to clone and build
