# Large Linear System Solver with Black-box Linear Algebra
### CI / Docker Integration

**Status:** In Progress

This branch focuses on building and testing Docker-containerized (Ubuntu/Linux) environments needed to install all solver-related dependencies for fully reproducible deployment. It also introduces a continuous integration (CI) pipeline designed to validate the robustness and correctness of the large linear system solver under controlled, containerized conditions.
